Of all the kites I own, this one probably has the most miles on it.
Back when I found kiting and had no life, I'd sit at Lake Crabtree all day in the summer waiting for a puff of wind.
It's an amazing design, I love the wingtip tensioners, and it's so tough that when kids come to my inland kiting spot with beach kites that need 12kts, I can give the 4D to them because it will fly in 4kts.
