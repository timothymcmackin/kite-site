Bought new from KHK in early 2013 and it's been super reliable.

Only problem I've had with it was the very first time I used it, at my lesson with Yuichi Murakami.
He watched me set up the safety for it, we had the lesson, and then we finished with me throwing the primary safety and self-rescuing.
However, the dodgy Cabrinha IDS safety released the secondary safety as well and the kite went tumbling free downwind.
Fortunately, another kiter caught it.
