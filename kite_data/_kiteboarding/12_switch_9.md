It was a rental from KHK but held up admirably over the years.
Just had to get a valve replaced in 2020.
It went out in a blaze of glory on 9/28/2023 when I crashed it so hard that the inflate valve cap blew clean off the kite and off the pigtail into Pamlico sound.
I haven't evaluated the rest of the kite, but I think after its many years of service, it will be retired with honor and made into sandbags.
