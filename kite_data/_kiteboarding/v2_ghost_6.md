Just got this kite in the fall of 2022 in anticipation of hydrofoiling in moderate wind.
It's a sign that I really enjoy the freedom of foiling when other people are starting to get onto twintips and doing small jumps.
I was hoping it would hold me up to about 20 mph, but it gets to be hard to handle in the high teens.
Maybe I should have gotten the 4m?
