I got this kite in my early obsession with kite-surfing because I wanted a depower kite to practice with.
I've since warned people off getting small depower kites because they perform poorly compared to fixed bridle kites in these small sizes.
This kite is super difficult to fly.
I had to fly it on an improvised broomstick depower bar because I didn't have anything else to use, so we call it the Broomstick Special.
