Julie saw this kite in a photo I took at the AKA convention in 2014 and had to have one.
I couldn't track one down but called the company and they sent me what looks like a prototype or factory second.
Strange to put together, with handwritten instructions, and unfortunately flies poorly, but she liked having it.
